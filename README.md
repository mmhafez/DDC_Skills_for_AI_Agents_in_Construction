## What is this?

A collection of **240 skills** for automating construction company processes with AI coding assistants.

### What is a "Skill"?

A skill is a `SKILL.md` file — structured instructions that an AI coding assistant can read and execute. Each skill describes a specific task: what problem it solves, what code to generate, and what tools are needed. You open a skill folder in your AI assistant, and it helps you implement the described functionality.

---

## Where to Start

### If you manage or lead a construction company:

**Step 1.** Read [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) — a non-technical overview of what can be automated and how to prioritize.

**Step 2.** Download the [Data-Driven Construction](Books/) book (free, 31 languages) — it explains the methodology behind these skills: how to assess your company's data maturity, identify bottlenecks, and plan digital transformation.

**Step 3.** Identify your biggest pain point in the table below and start with the corresponding skill.

### If you are a developer or IT lead:

**Step 1.** Install prerequisites (see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)).

**Step 2.** Pick a skill from the table below, open its folder in your AI assistant, and follow the `SKILL.md`.

**Step 3.** Adapt the generated code to your data and deploy.

---

## What Can You Automate?

Examples of common problems and which skills address them:

| Your problem | What the skill does | Skill to run | Folder |
|--------------|---------------------|--------------|--------|
| Searching for work item rates takes too long | Semantic search across 78,228 national + 55,719 global items in 26 languages | `semantic-search-cwicr` | `1_DDC_Toolkit/` |
| Estimators spend days building estimates manually | Generates estimates from historical data and templates | `estimate-builder` | `1_DDC_Toolkit/` |
| BIM models contain data but it's locked in RVT/IFC files | Extracts quantities and properties to Excel | `ifc-to-excel`, `rvt-to-excel` | `1_DDC_Toolkit/` |
| Daily/weekly reports take hours to compile | Automated data collection and report generation | `n8n-daily-report` | `3_DDC_Insights/` |
| Site photos pile up with no organization | AI classifies and tags site photos automatically | `n8n-photo-report` | `3_DDC_Insights/` |
| Data is scattered across Excel files, emails, PDFs | Finds all data sources and maps dependencies | `data-silo-detection` | `2_DDC_Book/` |
| No visibility into project KPIs | Dashboard with real-time metrics from your data | `kpi-dashboard` | `1_DDC_Toolkit/` |
| Budget overruns discovered too late | Scheduled budget vs. actual comparison | `budget-tracker` | `1_DDC_Toolkit/` |
| PDF specifications need to be searchable | Extracts text and tables from PDFs into structured data | `specification-extractor` | `2_DDC_Book/` |
| Schedule delays are hard to predict | Statistical analysis of schedule variance patterns | `schedule-delay-analyzer` | `3_DDC_Insights/` |
| The assistant gives outdated prices, specs or codes | Live web search for supplier prices, material availability, standards and market news | `brave-search-mcp` | `3_DDC_Insights/` |

*This is a selection of examples. The full collection contains 240 skills covering estimation, reporting, BIM, document processing, analytics, and more.*

---

## How to Use a Skill

```
1. Clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/datadrivenconstruction/DDC_Skills_for_AI_Agents_in_Construction.git

2. Open a skill folder in your AI assistant
   cd DDC_Skills_for_AI_Agents_in_Construction/1_DDC_Toolkit/CWICR-Database/semantic-search-cwicr/

3. The assistant reads SKILL.md and generates the code for you

4. Review, adapt to your data, and run
```

### Example: ETL Pipeline

```python
# Automatic processing of all Excel files from a folder

import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path

# Extract
all_data = [pd.read_excel(f) for f in Path("./estimates/").glob("*.xlsx")]
df = pd.concat(all_data)

# Transform
df['Total'] = df['Quantity'] * df['Unit_Price']
summary = df.groupby('Category')['Total'].sum()

# Load
summary.to_excel("summary_report.xlsx")
```

---

## Implementation Path

A typical automation project follows these stages. You don't need to do all of them — start with what solves your most pressing problem.

| Stage | What you do | Which skills help |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **1. Audit** | List all data sources in your company (Excel files, databases, BIM models, PDFs, emails) | `data-silo-detection`, `data-source-audit` |
| **2. Classify** | Understand what data you have: structured, semi-structured, or unstructured | `data-type-classifier`, `data-profiler` |
| **3. Connect** | Build ETL pipelines to extract and normalize data | `etl-pipeline`, `ifc-to-excel`, `specification-extractor` |
| **4. Automate** | Set up recurring reports, alerts, and dashboards | `n8n-daily-report`, `kpi-dashboard`, `budget-tracker` |
| **5. Analyze** | Apply analytics and ML to find patterns and predict outcomes | `cost-prediction`, `schedule-forecaster`, `risk-assessment` |

Each stage builds on the previous one, but you can enter at any point depending on your current state.

## Data Types in Construction

Construction data comes in three forms. Each requires a different processing approach, and each has corresponding skills:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph STRUCTURED["STRUCTURED"]
        S1[Excel]
        S2[SQL Database]
        S3[CSV]
    end

    subgraph SEMI["SEMI-STRUCTURED"]
        M1[IFC/BIM]
        M2[JSON]
        M3[XML]
    end

    subgraph UNSTRUCTURED["UNSTRUCTURED"]
        U1[PDF]
        U2[Photos]
        U3[Scans]
    end

    STRUCTURED -->|SQL queries, pandas| DB[(Central<br/>Database)]
    SEMI -->|ifcopenshell, parsers| DB
    UNSTRUCTURED -->|AI/OCR, pdfplumber| DB

    DB --> AUTO[Automation & Analytics]

    style STRUCTURED fill:#c8e6c9
    style SEMI fill:#fff9c4
    style UNSTRUCTURED fill:#ffcdd2
    style DB fill:#e1f5fe
    style AUTO fill:#f3e5f5
```

| Data type | Examples | Skills that process it |

---

## Data Flow in Construction

Skills cover the typical data pipeline: from raw input files to processed, actionable outputs.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph INPUT["📥 YOUR DATA"]
        A1[Excel Estimates]
        A2[Revit/IFC Models]
        A3[Site Photos]
        A4[PDF Documents]
    end

    subgraph DDC["⚙️ DDC SKILLS"]
        B1[ETL Pipeline]
        B2[IFC Parser]
        B3[AI Analysis]
        B4[Document OCR]
    end

    subgraph OUTPUT["📤 RESULTS"]
        C1[Auto Reports]
        C2[Auto Estimates]
        C3[Progress Tracking]
        C4[Searchable Data]
    end

    A1 --> B1 --> C1
    A2 --> B2 --> C2
    A3 --> B3 --> C3
    A4 --> B4 --> C4

    style INPUT fill:#e1f5fe
    style DDC fill:#fff3e0
    style OUTPUT fill:#e8f5e9
```

Construction data comes in three forms. Each requires a different processing approach:

| Data type | Examples | How skills process it |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| **Structured** | Excel, CSV, SQL databases | Direct queries and transformations |
| **Semi-structured** | IFC/BIM models, JSON, XML | Parsing with specialized libraries |
| **Unstructured** | PDF documents, photos, scans | AI/OCR extraction to structured format |
